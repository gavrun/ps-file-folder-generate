# ps-file-folder-generate

powershell script to create file/folder structure by pattern

total share size, 1 GB

number of files unlimited/configured, but under 1 MB each

folder and file naming should be only with letters and numbers, naming pattern array

a file must be a generated bit stream, but txt with random char stream will also work

subfolders depth is 2, root level, folder1, subfolder1, files

root is not a folder

folder names may be folder001, folder002, subfolder01
files may be name from A to Z for simplicity, Z.txt for example

configurable total size, file size, folder count, folder depth, file count

message script execution folder and create new 'root' folder 

structure to be expanding flexibly, need check if folder/file exists

variability for creating groups of folders by size and structure

creating a pyramid style shape of file structure 
from fat heavy folders/subfolders with 4 MB files to thin folders without subfolders, folders without files

modify filename pattern to AA, AB array

will add more later when i know how
